# Web Engineering 2021-2022 / Lab2 RPC over HTTP

Please, go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/lab2-rpc-over-http/wiki) in order to get the instructions for this assignment.

## Primary goal

Discover how to run the `server` and the `client`. 
Note that the `server` requires code derived from `translator.xsd`, 
and the `client` requires code derived from a `wsdl` file published by the `server`. 

Next you must ensure that the client show something similar to:
```
Result of translating [hello] is [hola].
```

## Secondary goal (:gift:)

Some ideas for obtaining a :gift: if you are the first that:

- **The server side**: Test the server side [properly](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ws/docs/3.1.1/reference/html/#_server_side_testing)
- **Back to the future**: Upgrade to WSDL 2.0 and SOAP 1.2
- **Armored SOAP**: Secure the endpoint [WS-Security](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ws/docs/3.1.1/reference/html/#security)
- **Let's contract**: Re-implement the project following [Writing Contract-First Web Services tutorial](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ws/docs/3.1.1/reference/html/#tutorial)
- **Do the Google way**: Re-implement the project with [gRPC](https://yidongnan.github.io/grpc-spring-boot-starter/en/)
- **Do the Facebook way**: Re-implement the project with [GraphQL](https://www.graphql-java.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-spring-boot/)
